                The COE would support the Governments imperative to set up
                world-class ecosystem in their Industries to attract
                investments. Availability of trained manpower and Industry ready
                workforce is a key missing link towards making the state
                “Destination of Choice”.<br />
                The COE can focus on the following profile of students: improve
                employability of students and professionals from the state
                through skill development and innovation / research projects
                with Industry. Besides, to create environment to foster
                innovation and entrepreneurship, innovation hub is being
                completed to incubate the start-ups. <br />
                The above COE could also be used for Industry professions to
                train their work force based on pay per use model and an
                ecosystem of starts up based on such COE would easily justify
                the investments in Dassault technologies.

                Industry 4.0 is focused on creating “smart” environment within
                the production system. creating intelligent products, processes,
                and procedures. In the smart factory workers, machines and
                resources communicate easily.<br />
                Digital manufacturing has been considered, over the last decade,
                as a highly promising set of technologies for reducing product
                development times and cost as well as for addressing the need
                for customization, increased product quality, and faster
                response to the market. This paper describes the evolution of
                information technology systems in manufacturing, outlining their
                characteristics and the challenges to be addressed in the
                future<br />
                <!--The need for reduced development time together with the growing demand for more customer-oriented product variants have led to the next generation of information technology (IT) systems in manufacturing.<br />
                            Technology is driving rapid innovation in manufacturing. Rapid technological change is transforming the production of goods and services across the global economy. As the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), advanced robotics, augmented reality technologies, and 3-D printing converge in the years ahead, manufacturers must keep up with the tools that keep their operations competitive. In the factory of the future, costs plummet, efficiency increases, and high-quality, quick turnaround ‘batches of one’ become feasible.<br />
                            MES software is one of the technologies making this transformation possible.<br />
                             Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are real-time control systems for monitoring and managing all the work-in-process on the shop floor. MES tracks and documents the transformation of raw materials through finished goods. The systems work in real time to enable the orchestration of multiple resources in the production process, including material, personnel, machines, and support services.<br />
                            According to LNS Research, MES is evolving into Manager of Managers (MoM) scope that connects shop-floor automation systems to the overall enterprise software network, and includes applications like quality management and planning, scheduling and dispatching, as well as production execution.”<br />
                            MES facilitates the integration of manufacturing floor systems with engineering and business systems, allows a streamlining of business processes that span across the organization.
                            provides global management of processes, performance, and visibility, magnifying the impact of operational improvements across the whole enterprise.<br />
                            Manufacturing Process Intelligence gives broad, real-time visibility to shorten cycle time, reduce scrap and rework, increase quality, and achieve better schedule adherence.
                            real-time analytics and reporting are critical to maintaining efficient, competitive plant operations and identifying areas for continuous process improvement.<br />
                            manufacturing excellence by tightly linking labour tracking to plant activities not only production, but also warehouse, maintenance and quality in a total paperless manufacturing environment.<br />
                            maintenance to minimize disruptions and maximize uptime within manufacturing environment.
                            synchronizing inventory management with production, resulting in vastly improved inventory accuracy and manufacturing efficiencies.<br />
                            synchronized manufacturing operations by providing built-in links for seamless integration between third-party, external business systems like sap, ERP etc,<br />
                            interface with a wide range of manufacturing equipment (machines, IIoT devices and sensors, RFID readers, robots, automation controllers) on the plant floor, enabling a high degree of automation with manufacturing operations across your enterprise.<br />
                            Digital Manufacturing and MES solutions by providing optimization, planning and scheduling. adds the power of constraint-based, finite-capacity resource optimization, and synchronization of production flows – from raw materials through finished products. The result is comprehensive digital continuity with artificial intelligence driven decision support.<br />
                            identification of manufacturing bottlenecks, rapid schedule modifications and simulations.
                            scheduling and integrated management of product and process related constraints across multiple resources such as machines, tools, and operators<br />
                            material flow and capacity synchronization system to enable Just-in-Time (demand and manufacturing integration across all Bill of Materials levels). coordinate purchase and work order, creates provisional traceability and forecast material kitting orders, allowing manufacturers to maximize inventory and manufacturing capacity with production flow constraints. -->
